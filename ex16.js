// Exercise 16: Use chaining to double the even numbers and then sum them.
// Example: [3, 10, 15, 7, 22, 18] â†’ 100
// Use method chaining and write the solution in one line

const numbers = [3, 10, 15, 7, 22, 18]

console.log(
  numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0).reduce((sum, n) => sum + n * 2, 0)
) // Expected output: 100
